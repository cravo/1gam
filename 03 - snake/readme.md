#SNAKE III ARENA

My 1gam entry for March 2016.  It's snake, vs. other snakes in a timed battle to score the most points, written for the pico8 fantasy console by Lexaloffle.

Pretty happy with this one.  If I'd had more time I'd have spent it making the opponent snake AI better, that's about it.

There is a web-playable version of the game at http://goo.gl/jk9K9s
