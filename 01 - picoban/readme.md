#picoban

My 1gam entry for January 2016.  Picoban is a Sokoban clone written for the pico8 fantasy console by Lexaloffle.

There are only 5 levels as I only started this project on 30th January so I didn't have a lot of time.  Some of the levels were copied from designs found on a Google image search for Sokoban, as again, I didn't really have time to design a whole bunch of levels.

There is a web-playable version of the game at http://www.matthewcraven.co.uk/games/picoban/picoban.html
