#home

My 1gam entry for February 2016.  Home is an oldschool platformer along the lines of Manic Miner written for the pico8 fantasy console by Lexaloffle.

This game is bigger in scope than my January entry - I originally wanted it to be even bigger but I have run out of time to design more rooms.

There is a web-playable version of the game at http://www.matthewcraven.co.uk/games/home/home.html
