#RUN RIGHT 2

My 1gam entry for April 2016.  It's the sequel to a Flash game I wrote ages ago, this time written for the pico8 fantasy console by Lexaloffle.

Made in a real rush as I only just started it with a couple of days of the month left, so it's a quick re-purposing of the code from "Home".

There is a web-playable version of the game at http://goo.gl/oDpHTy
